## Overview / Contents

- [Export Spline to a .obj file](Spline2Obj.md)
- [XML Tools](XMLTools.md)


## Installation
1. Download [latest GE Toolbox release](https://github.com/w33zl/GE-Toolbox/releases/latest)
2. Unzip the contents of the `GE-Toolbox_vX.X.X` zip archive into your user scripts folder for GE (e.g. `%LocalAppData%\GIANTS Editor 64bit 9.0.3\scripts\`)
3. (Re)start Giants Editor

> ***Important:** Make sure you extract the contents of the zip archive directly into the scripts-folder. If you download the code manually using the "Download zip" option you should extract the subcontents of the "GE-Toolbox-master"-folder, i.e. the "GE Toolbox (by w33zl)" folder should be placed directly in the scripts-folder.*

### Productivity Tips
1. Install [GE-HAM](https://github.com/w33zl/GE-Hotkeys-and-Macros) to be able to bind keyboard shortcuts to the scripts above, see this video by Ola Haldor to [see GE-HAM in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lUqKiSBndc).
2. Install [AutoHotPie](https://github.com/dumbeau/AutoHotPie) to get convinient pie menu access to features in GE, see this video by OlaHaldor to [view the pie menu in action](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t2iR5MWhxKI).
